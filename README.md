# Mini-Stepper-Motor-Elevator
Uses the FRDM-K64F development board for stepper motor controls and the Arduino Uno for button inputs, LED light indicators, and the SG90 Servo motor.

There are 3 "floors" to the mini-elevator and there is call/summon button on each floor for the elevator. Floor selection buttons are found outside of the elevator 
for ease of access since it is a mini-elevator.

note: actual elevator chamber was left outside to reduce strain on the stepper motor, and is represented by a much lighter single piece of cardboard.
